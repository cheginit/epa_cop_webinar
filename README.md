# EPA's CoP Webinar

In this webinar, we will focus on the classification of NHD catchments across CONUS into
three types based on their hydrological characteristics, specifically examining drought
propagation mechanisms based on [Apurv et al., (2017)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017WR021445).
Utilizing StreamCat data, we will train a machine learning model and leverage the HyRiver
software stack for efficient data retrieval and processing operations.
